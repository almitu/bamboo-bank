1. first we need to make sure the project is a GIT project
> git init
> git add .  //adds all files, so be sure there is no private info
> git commit -m "initial commit"


2. add my GitHub repository where to push my project:

> git remote add origin urlOfMyGitHubRepository:
example:
> git remote add origin https://github.com/almitu/bamboo-bank.git

3. check whether the repository is added:

> git remote -v 
wll show us "push url"

4. git push -u origin master 


****************************************************************************

if we need to remove to change the remote to SSH or something else we type:

> git remote rm _remoteToBeRemoved  // origin - is usualy the default remote

example:
> git remote rm origin

*****************************************************************************


if there is an error when we are trying to push the project we can force the push, but we need to know that with that forced push we will delete the remoted branch and change it insted with our local, so keep in mind that it might have dristic changes for the project

> git push -f origin <branch> 
example: 
> git push -f origin master
